# FYLLA Studio Frontend Clone

A responsive frontend clone of the **Studio** page from [FYLLA Template](https://fylla-template.framer.website/studio), built with 💻 HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and a touch of inspiration.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This is a **frontend practice project** where I recreated the look and feel of the Studio page from the FYLLA Framer template. The goal was to sharpen my design skills and understand layout structuring, spacing, and responsiveness using Tailwind CSS.
